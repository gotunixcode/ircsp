Syntax: ^BRECOVER nickname [password]^B
 
Allows you to recover your nickname if someone else has
taken it; this does the same thing that ^N does
automatically if someone tries to use a kill-protected
nickname.
	
When you give this command, ^N will bring a fake user
online with the same nickname as the user you're trying to
recover your nick from, causing the IRC servers to
disconnect the other user.  This fake user will remain
online for 30 minutes to ensure that the other user does not
immediately reconnect; after that time, you can reclaim
your nick.  Alternatively, use the RELEASE command
/msg ^N HELP RELEASE) to get the nick back sooner.
