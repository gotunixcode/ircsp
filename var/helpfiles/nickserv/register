Syntax: /msg ^N ^BREGISTER password^B


Registers your nickname in the NickServ database. Once
your nick is registered, you can use the ^BSET^B and
^BACCESS^B commands to configure your nick's settings
as you like them.  Make sure you remember the password you
use when registering.  You willneed it to make changes to 
your nick later. (Case does matter)
 
Passwords must be at least 8 charaters long, Try to 
use something that is not easily guessable. For example
Using your real name or your nickname as a password is
probably a bad idea.

Don't use spaces in your passwords either.
