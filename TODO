2.0.1
	- debug.h
		Debug flags will be moved from configure.ac to here

	- Nickinfo_Blacklist
		- Need to create a linked list/database to store blacklisted nicknames.
			- Need to add a few flags to black listed nicknames
				1) JUPE - For blacklisted nicknamed that will be Juped
				2) REGISTER - For blacklisted nicknames that are just not allowed to be registered
				3) SERVICE - Blacklisted service nicknames just to prevent users from using typical service nicknames
				   Such as "N", "NickServ", "Uworld", etc.

	- Need to make a ConfigModule nickname search that will search all ConfigModule objects for ServiceNicknames
	  to prevent someone from being able to register a service nickname.


	  - Need to rename / standardize function names and make a code standard doc
	  - to start i'm thinking all Linked list function calls will be named using a psudeo CamelCase example below
			1) Nickinfo_Register   - Create a new object in the linked list
			2) Nickinfo_Search     - Search the list for a object
			3) Nickinfo_Unregister - Remove a object from the list

	- All other objects will be named as follows
		1) nickinfo_validate
		2) nickinfo_expire

	- Module functions that will be linked to function pointers in our main codebase
		cmd_join -> libundernet_cmd_join
